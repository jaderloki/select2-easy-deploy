# Select2 - Easy Deploy
Select2 Easy Deploy is an extension for the Select2 jQuery plugin that simplifies the deployment process alongside the current Select2 features. 

With this extension, you can easily add Select2 fields to your website without creating a separate script for each field. 

It includes custom div containers with images inside the option, dropdown positioning, and the ability to catch and place an element next to the dropdown. 

Select2 Easy Deploy also allows you to send classes to the select2 span field, create a small version of the select, and automatically load a value from an option.
